# Electron_charge2mass_exp
Short script to process experimental results and compute the electron charge to mass ratio with the distributions.

The repository mimics results taken of an experiment for which the aim is to measure the electron's charge to mass ratio. The accepted value is 1.758820 Ã— 10<sup> 11 </sup> C/kg.

The experiment follows the Thompson method for measuring the charge to mass ratio of electrons. The main physical equation governing the experiment is given by,

$$\frac{q}{m} = \frac{2V}{B^{2} R^{2}}$$

where the left hand term is the charge to mass ratio, $V$ is the accelerating voltage, $B$ the magnetic field that induces circular paths of the emitted electrons and $R$ is the radius of their trajectory.
$B$ is expressed in terms of the current $I$, used to generate the field, $B = kI$. $k$ is a constant, taken to be $7.5\pm0.51 \times 10^{-4}$ T/A. In this repository, the experimental noise on $V$, $I$ and $R$ is assumed to be 
gaussian, with parameters:

|  Variable | $\mu$  | $\sigma$  |
|---|---|---|
| $V$ (V)     |    82.2   |    2.0      |
| $I$ (A)     |    1.4   |     0.1     |
| $R$ (cm)     |    2.92   |   0.11       |

The data for these, taken across 1000 samples is given in csv files (V.csv, I.csv, R.csv).

From the mean values, the estimate ratio is 1.77 $\pm$ 0.37 $\times 10^{11}$ C/kg. However, if one calculates this "on the fly", using the individual entries of each distirbution and averaging the computed ratios, the value is of 1.81 $\times 10^{11}$ C/kg.

The estimated relative uncertainty through error propagation (assuming independence of variables) on the ratio is given by,

$$ \sqrt{\left( \frac{\sigma_{V}}{\mu_{V}} \right )^{2}+\left( \frac{2\sigma_{I}}{\mu_{I}} \right )^{2}+\left( \frac{2\sigma_{R}}{\mu_{R}} \right )^{2}+\left( \frac{2\sigma_{k}}{\mu_{k}} \right )^{2}}. $$

The code in C provided reads in the data and outputs the mean values, including for the charge to mass ratio. The distributions are given as well.
